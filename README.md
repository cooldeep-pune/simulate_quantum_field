Simulates Simple Quantum Field

Chahalachal field occupies whole "Universe" and is constantly in resonance state.


The energy fluctuations creates terbulance in the field. Which forms Particle and Antiparticles [Forms of a multidimentional structure in field]. The terbulance can be classified in 5 Levels and which can be elivated to from base level 0 to level 5 which creates multidimentional structures.


[Level 5] Bing Bang or New Begining

[Level 4] Chahalachal field packed down to blackhole.

[Level 3]
