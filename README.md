Simulates Simple Quantum Field

Chahalachal field occupies the whole "Universe" and is constantly in a resonance state.


The energy fluctuations create turbulence or fluctuations in the field. The turbulences form Particles and Antiparticles [Forms of a multidimensional structure in the field], Black Hole, Stars [Neutron Stars, Red Giant, etc.], Level 2 [Protons, Neutrons, etc.], and Level 1 [Electrons, Photons].

The terbulance can be classified in 5 Levels and which can be elivated from base level 0 to level 5 which creates multidimentional structures as follows.


[Level 5] Bing Bang or New Begining

[Level 4] Chahalachal field packed down to Blackhole.

[Level 3] Stars [Neutron Stars, Red Giant, etc] 

[Level 2] [Protons, Neutrons, etc] 

[Level 1] [Electrons, Photons]

[Level 0] Chahalachal field in resonance state 
This state creates fluctuations resulting in Particle and Antiparticles, and those annihilate or decay to


[Level 0] [Electrons, Photons]
