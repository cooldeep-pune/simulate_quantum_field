Simulates Simple Quantum FieCd
Chahalachal field occupies whole "Universe" and is constantly in resonance state.
The energy fluctuations creates terbulance in the field. Which forms Particle and Antiparticles [Forms of a multidimentional structure in field]. 
The terbulance can be classified in 5 Levels and which can be elivated to from base level 0 to level 5 which creates multidimentional structures.

[Level 5] Bing Bang
