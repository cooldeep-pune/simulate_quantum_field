Simulates Simple Quantum Field

Chahalachal field occupies the whole "Universe" and is constantly in a resonance state.


The energy fluctuations create turbulence or fluctuations in the field. The turbulences form Particles and Antiparticles [Forms of a multidimensional structure in the field], Black Hole, Stars [Neutron Stars, Red Giant, etc.], Level 2 [Protons, Neutrons, etc.], and Level 1 [Electrons, Photons].

The terbulance can be classified in 5 Levels and which can be elivated from base level 0 to level 5 which creates multidimentional structures as follows.


[Level 5] Bing Bang or New Begining
The Chahalachal field achieves Level 5 when it reaches the highest energy state. The Big Bang created massive turbulence to form particles or structures in all energy states simultaneously at more than 13.8 billion years,

[Level 4] Chahalachal field packed down to Blackhole.

The Chahalachal field achieved the Level 4 Energy state when the Level 3 structure crunched to the next energy state to form Black Holes.

[Level 3] Atoms Neutron + Protos bonds [Star formation, Neutron Stars]

The Chahalachal field achieves the Level 3 Energy state when Level 2 particles boost up to the next energy state to form atoms and complex structures like Stars, galaxies, and neutrons.

[Level 2] [Protons, Neutrons, etc.] 

The Chahalachal field archives the Level 2 Energy state, when Level 1 particles boost up to the next energy state to form complex particles like Protons and neutrons.

[Level 1] [Electrons, Photons]

Chahalachal field archives Level 1 Energy state when Level 1 particles achieve persistence. 

[Level 0] Chahalachal field in resonance state 

This state creates fluctuations resulting in Particles and Antiparticles, and those annihilate or decay and remain in Level 0.

This project demonstrates the simulation of the creation of the particles from the Level 0 resonant state.
